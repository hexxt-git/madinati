                </h3>
                <p>
                    Our journey began at the prestigious "Boumerdes Smart City" Hackathon 2024,
                    where a personal challenge became our mission. While attempting to reach the
                    event venue, we faced the common struggles of public transport navigation:
                    unreliable schedules, unclear routes, and outdated information. Existing
                    solutions like Google Maps fell short in our local context, inspiring us to
                    create a solution tailored for Algeria's unique urban landscape. We envisioned a
                    platform that would enable the user to go from point A to point B without the
                    stress of planning, asking for directions, or waiting for the next bus. The
                    application had to provide real-time updates, personalized routes based on user
                    preferences, and a seamless experience for both locals and tourists.

                    At the heart of Madinati lies a sophisticated pathfinding system, powered by our

                    data from Algiers' integrated transport network, including buses, metro lines,
                    trams, and telepheriques. Our solution adapts to real-time conditions, ensuring
                    you always have the most efficient route at your fingertips.
